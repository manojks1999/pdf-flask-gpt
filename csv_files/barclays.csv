"■ In 2021, we paid £2,781m of tax globally, of which £1,211m was paid in the UK. This significant contribution to the UK economy reflects the fact that we are a UK-headquartered bank and that the UK is the main base of our global operations. ■ A large amount of the taxes we pay are specific to the UK banking sector. For example, we pay bank levy to the UK Government based on the value of the liabilities on our balance sheet. ■ An additional sector specific tax is the UK banking profits surcharge (an additional 8% tax on top of the standard UK corporation tax rate), which means that UK banks pay tax at 27% on banking profits compared to the standard UK corporation tax rate of 19%. ■ Over the last decade, Barclays has paid over £14bn of taxes in the UK.",9,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"We seek to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law and we take account of established practice in the territories in which we operate. We are transparent in both the disclosure of our tax affairs to tax authorities as well as our tax reporting to other stakeholders. When we have a new product or transaction, we check that the tax treatment is well-understood and the tax obligations are properly managed. Where necessary, we consult with external advisers to help us manage our tax position and ensure that we are making appropriate decisions. We also consult with external advisers to help us understand the implications of new or proposed tax law.",11,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Approach to tax Here we explore how our approach applies to our clients and our businesses.,12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Our clients Our tax principles make it very clear that all tax planning for our clients must support genuine commercial activity. While our clients are ultimately responsible for any decisions in relation to their tax affairs, we, like other banks, do provide some tax related products to our clients. These products are well-understood by tax authorities and often deliver tax incentives specifically intended by governments.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Conversely, for example, we would not provide non-standard loan funding to a client, where the funding is integral to the client’s tax planning, if the tax planning does not comply with the spirit, as well as the letter, of the law.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Our business Tax influences decisions about how we run and organise our business and about where we base our operations. Making these decisions is an integral part of running a global commercial organisation. When tax is a factor in deciding where or how we do business, the decisions we make are consistent with our tax principles and profits are taxed in the locations in which the economic activity generating them takes place.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Accordingly, transactions that artificially transfer profits into a low tax jurisdiction would not be consistent with this approach or our tax principles. A key part of ensuring we pay taxes in the countries where economic value is created is how we price transactions between our group companies, more commonly known as ‘transfer pricing’.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"When we invest in our business, we may benefit from tax incentives as intended by national governments, some of which are discussed further on page 11.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Approach to tax,12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Our approach to transfer pricing in more detail:,12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"The prices applied to our intra-group transactions are representative of the prices that would be paid in respect of transactions between independent parties (also known as ‘arm’s-length pricing’). The ‘arm’s-length prices’ that we apply are derived from established and widely accepted international standards such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are applied on a globally consistent basis across all countries in which we operate. We seek to comply with all global and local documentation requirements to support the arm’s length prices applied to our intra-group transactions including, for instance, undertaking external economic benchmarking studies of comparable transactions between third parties. Tax authorities may sometimes take a differing view of what an arm’s-length price should be for a transaction. This can lead to the same income being taxed in two countries (often referred to as ‘double taxation’).",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"National governments often seek to reduce double taxation by entering into double taxation treaties between one another. These treaties include mechanisms for tax authorities to agree an arm’s-length price for a transaction between one another and the taxpayer. These mechanisms can include ‘Mutual Agreement Procedures’ (MAP) which allow tax authorities in two countries to agree on a mutually acceptable arm’s-length price where the taxpayer has been unable to reach an agreement with the tax authorities directly. Treaties may also include a mechanism for tax authorities to agree an arm’s-length price on an upfront basis with a taxpayer through ‘Advance Pricing Agreements’ (APA). Where we are or may be subject to double taxation, we do seek to reach agreement on an appropriate arm’s-length price through one of the generally available mechanisms outlined above.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"We have also historically incorporated companies under the laws of other low tax jurisdictions, particularly the Cayman Islands, because the local company law makes it simple and cost effective to set up and manage companies. All of the profits generated in these companies are subject to corporation tax at a rate at least equal to the UK corporation tax rate.",12,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

As digital banking, international transactions and transaction security become increasingly central to all our lives, we are investing more than ever in building the Barclays of the future. We spend significant amounts on research & development (R&D) each year to research, design and develop innovative technological solutions that protect our millions of customers and lead the world in digital banking.

The Glasgow campus alongside other new campus developments in Whippany, New Jersey, and Pune, India, are part of our global strategy to create world-class facilities. Our investment in the Glasgow campus is expected to have around 5,000 employees by 2023. Our investment to construct and fit out the new campus with energy-saving plant, machinery and equipment will attract capital allowances, which provide UK tax relief on some types of capital expenditure. Similarly, when we refurbish our existing high street branches throughout the UK, some of that investment may benefit from capital allowances.",13,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

It is also possible that the interpretation of tax law or generally accepted custom or practice may change over time. ■ Operational tax risk: The risk of unexpected financial cost, for example, additional tax payments, interest or penalties, arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems or human errors resulting in the filing of incorrect tax returns, the late filing of tax returns or the late payment of taxes. ■ Stakeholder perception risk: The risk that an action or decision we take will reduce the trust in our integrity and competence by tax authorities, our regulators, investors or the public, leading to potential financial loss and reputational damage.",14,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"Our commitment to information sharing We cooperate with tax authorities globally to reduce the scope for individuals and companies to evade tax. We do this by fulfilling all of our information sharing obligations under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). CRS requires information relating to customers to be collated and provided to tax authorities who share this information with one another. FATCA is an international standard for the automatic exchange of information relating to US persons. We support the aims of CRS and FATCA and have met all of our 2021 information reporting obligations. Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a key part of the UK government’s plans to become one of the most digitally advanced tax administrations in the world, making it easier for individuals and businesses to comply with their tax obligations and pay the right amount of tax. We are contributing to making MTD a success as we provide a large amount of information to HMRC such as interest earned by our customers on savings accounts as well as details of remuneration paid as an employer. Furthermore, we have put strong governance procedures in place across our business to enable us to fulfil our disclosure obligations under the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (commonly known as DAC 6) and the OECD’s Mandatory Disclosure Rules. These rules help to combat harmful tax practices by requiring the disclosure to tax authorities of cross- border arrangements which feature certain ‘hallmarks’.",16,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Pillar One will reallocate a portion of international businesses’ profits to the territories in which their customers are based for taxation purposes.

"Tax evasion is the deliberate and illegal non-payment, or underpayment, of any tax and often involves concealing income or assets from tax authorities. Tax evasion is a crime in the UK and in other countries where we operate. Barclays is committed to only dealing with customer or client assets that have been appropriately declared to the relevant tax authority. Barclays plays a full role in global efforts to combat tax evasion and has worked alongside governments and international organisations, such as the OECD, to support their efforts to combat tax evasion. In the UK, Barclays is an active member of the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT), a public-private partnership between law enforcement agencies and the financial sector to share and analyse real time intelligence about money laundering (including tax evasion) risks.",17,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Barclays is subject to the provisions of the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 which introduced a corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion in relation to UK and foreign taxes. We do not engage in tax evasion and do not provide products or services with the aim of facilitating tax evasion by others. We also take a zero tolerance approach to any person acting for us or on our behalf who helps customers evade tax in any country. The measures we have in place to prevent this include: ■ training designed for all staff on tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation ■ enhanced due diligence procedures for higher risk customers and third parties ■ specific tax evasion ‘red flags’ to help staff identify potential tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation cases ■ assessment and oversight of tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation risk managed through our financial crime risk management framework and related governance.,17,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"■ In the UK, this involves maintaining a professional and constructive relationship with HMRC. We have regular meetings with HMRC to discuss their enquiries and material issues in relation to our tax affairs. This helps focus both our and HMRC’s resources on the most important issues. ■ As a large group, we make hundreds of filings to HMRC every year, and aim to make all of these on time. We also aim to make these tax filings as clear as possible and include explanations as required to ensure that our returns are easy to understand. ■ Where we face significant uncertainty in relation to the application of tax law, we may seek to agree with HMRC how the tax law should apply. Any agreements have not provided any advantage to us as they have not resulted in any tax treatment that would not be available to other taxpayers. ■ In the rare instances that we ultimately need to have recourse to the Courts to resolve tax issues, we continue to interact with HMRC in a constructive and helpful manner.",18,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

We refer to this uncertainty as tax risk and it is discussed in detail on page 12. ■ Where there is significant uncertainty or complexity in relation to a tax risk, we may seek advice from external experts. This gives us confidence that our tax returns are appropriate. ■ We proactively seek to identify, evaluate, manage and monitor UK tax risks to ensure our financial exposure is well understood and is within a level that we consider acceptable. ■ Our reputation is very important to us and we take our external stakeholders’ expectations into account when we make decisions in relation to our tax affairs.",18,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – ability to detect To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud.,21,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"In this risk assessment we considered the following: ■ Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and reviews of Barclays’ internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations. ■ Enquiries of management, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating to: – detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and – the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls to facilitate remote/hybrid working. ■ The Group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels. ■ Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries. The forensic specialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions and were consulted throughout the audit where further guidance was deemed necessary.

"We have identified five fraud risks which were communicated to component audit teams.

"Various factors mean that the profit we report as being earned in the UK differs from the profits on which we are subject to UK corporation tax. In particular, being a UK-headquartered bank, the profit figure includes dividends received from overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxed in the UK as they have already been taxed in the jurisdiction in which those profits were earned. A large part of our accounting profits reported as earned in the UK in 2021, were made up of dividends received from our overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxable under UK law. In addition, the tax treatment and accounting treatment of various expenses differ, for example Additional Tier 1 coupons and cash contributions to our main UK pension fund.",22,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

"While these activities are taxed locally at a rate above the UK corporation tax rate, we paid no corporation tax in Luxembourg in 2021 as our taxable profits were offset by substantial tax losses brought forward from prior years, and also due to dividend income not being taxable under Luxembourg law.

"Note 1 – Basis of preparation The CBCR Information as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been prepared based on the requirements of the Capital Requirements (Country- by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 as interpreted by the directors of the Company. The CBCR Information does not constitute the Company’s statutory accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Statutory accounts for 2020 have been delivered to the registrar of companies, and those for 2021 will be delivered in due course.

The table provides the following information for Barclays in 2021:,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Country: In most cases, we have determined which country to report activity under by looking at the country of tax residence. Where activities are conducted by entities that are not themselves subject to tax (for example certain partnerships), then we have considered other factors such as the location of management and employees, the jurisdiction in which the majority of revenues are generated, and the country of establishment of the entity’s parent company. In these cases, it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one where profits, upon which the tax is paid, are reported.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Commentary: We have explained the nature of our activities in each country. That disclosure is included within the commentary column in the table above together with our explanation of any matters of interest.,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Tax contribution,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Turnover: Turnover gives an indication of the size of our business in each country, and we have ordered the table in descending order. Turnover includes net interest income, net fee and commission income, net trading income, net investment income, net premiums from insurance contracts and net claims and benefits incurred on insurance contracts. Some of the turnover numbers need to be treated with care as technical accounting requirements applicable to the way these figures are prepared mean there is an element of double counting. Profits generated in the US and then paid to the UK as a dividend for example, will be included within both the US and UK figures. Adjustments to address this double counting, called intra-group eliminations, are broken down by type (dividends, recharges, hedging and other) at the end of the table and total £5,683m for 2021 in relation to turnover. Additionally, and again to avoid double counting, turnover numbers in each country exclude dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Profit/(loss) before tax: These numbers are accounting profits. As with the turnover figures, these numbers include some double counting which is reconciled at the bottom of the table. Total intra-group eliminations for the profit/(loss) before tax column are £2,840m. In addition, to avoid double counting, profits attributable to dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country are also excluded.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Total tax paid: This column shows the total tax Barclays actually paid in each country in 2021. The following columns break this total down into its constituent parts. Most of the taxes paid in any given year will not relate directly to the profits earned in that year. For example, bank levy is a tax on how we fund ourselves and is paid regardless of whether or not we make any profit.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Approach to tax,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Corporation tax paid: This column records corporation tax actually paid in each country in 2021. Corporation tax payable in any given year is not directly comparable to profits for the same 12-month period. This is because tax on profits is paid across multiple years. In addition, taxable profits are calculated as prescribed by tax law which usually results in differences between accounting and taxable profits. This means it is possible that relatively high corporation tax can be paid when accounting profits are low and vice-versa. The amount of tax paid shown in the financial statements also includes withholding taxes. Withholding taxes comprise the tax charged on dividends or other income received, which is typically paid at the point of distribution from one country to another. We have kept these amounts separate from corporation tax paid by country in the table above.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Employer payroll taxes paid: These are taxes borne by us, based on government social security policies in each country and, for example, in the UK represent employer’s national insurance contributions. They do not represent income tax on payments to our employees or employees’ national insurance contributions which are taxes collected but not borne by us. VAT paid: This includes VAT and other consumption taxes (including goods and services tax, consumption tax and US sales and use taxes). The amounts relate to irrecoverable VAT paid. Unlike many other businesses, financial services businesses are only able to reclaim a small proportion of the VAT they incur, making VAT a significant part of our tax contribution. Not all countries have a VAT system which is why there are no entries against some countries within the table. These numbers do not include any VAT charged to customers on Barclays’ products and services which we collect on behalf of tax authorities.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
Country by country data,27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"Bank levy paid: Bank levy is a tax paid based on the value of certain liabilities on our balance sheet. As with corporation tax, bank levy is paid across multiple years and therefore the tax paid of £241m in 2021 should not be expected to equate to the accounting accrual in 2021. Other: Other taxes are the material property taxes that Barclays paid in 2021 and include, for example, taxes on the property we use in our business such as our network of high street branches. Public subsidies received: Includes only direct support from governments such as government grants. Average number of employees: The number of employees has been calculated as the average number of employees, on a monthly full-time equivalent basis, who were permanently employed by Barclays PLC or one of its subsidiaries during the relevant period. An average of the number of full-time equivalent employees at the end of each calendar month has been calculated. Contractors, agency staff, and staff on extended leave, such as maternity leave, are excluded. Intra-group eliminations: These include adjustments that relate principally to transactions between Barclays businesses in different countries which are included within the individual country turnover, but are then eliminated in determining the overall Barclays Group results to avoid double counting. Intra-group eliminations include dividend payments, income from intra-group transfers of assets, and income arising from hedging transactions that occur at a consolidated Barclays Group level rather than an individual entity level.",27,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf

Barclays is helping Thai restaurant group Giggling Squid deliver on its expansion ambitions.,28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"After opening their first restaurant in 2009, Andy and Pranee Laurillard felt their existing bank couldn’t provide the necessary expertise or funding to help them keep growing, so they turned to us. Our Corporate Banking team supported with the refinancing of three new restaurants in the Giggling Squid group, and worked with the Laurillards to introduce private equity. With our help, the couple were able to attract an additional £6.4m investment from the Business Growth Fund. Giggling Squid was also named in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100, ranking it as one of the UK’s fastest growing companies, a feat it went on to achieve four years in a row.",28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Barclays helped Giggling Squid remain resilient, securing a £5m CBILS loan to provide vital liquidity when it was needed most. We also help them leverage the benefits of digital connectivity – from the integration with our iPortal service, to our ability to power its payment platforms and increase adoption of card payment technology.",28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
"This year the business plans to open further sites, growing its presence in the Midlands and North of England. Barclays’ deep relationship with Giggling Squid, which now operates 42 restaurants and employs around 1,200 staff across the UK, remains critical to the outstanding customer experience it provides, and to its growth story.",28,with-highlights-comments-barclays-country-snapshot-2021pdf
